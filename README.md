# docker-macvlan-network-appliances
Documentation and working configs for running network‑appliance containers (like Omada Controller and AdGuard Home) on Docker using MACVLAN with deterministic MAC/IP identity. Includes the systemd shim, boot‑ordering fixes, and the pitfalls I hit transitioning from bridge/host networking to a stable, bare‑metal‑like LAN setup.
